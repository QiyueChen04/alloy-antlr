TODO:
- CUP always uses Name (allows both ID and QNAME), but in ANTLR we use both name and qname
- IMPLIES is not used

- CUP is accepting a lot more things than the grammar defined in Book. Not sure which one to follow.

- some
- one
- lone
- seems like CUP doesn't create ExprBinary.Op.JOIN directly

- UNTIL keyword
- bit manipulation operators



CHECKED:
- moduleDecl
- importDecl
- enumDecl
- factDecl
- assertDecl
